The passwords of the connectors are stored in the config.py file. This file is included on the gitignore so you should add it yourself by copying the snippet and inserting the correct username, password, ip address and port.

```python
def username():
    username = "username"
    return username

def password():
    password = "password"
    return password

def ip():
    address = "ip address"
    return address

def port():
    port = int[port]
    return port    
```

You can connect to the mongodb using mongoconnect.py
